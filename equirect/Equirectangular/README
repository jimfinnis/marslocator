Process the files by running "process.py" and then "convertToPng8".

Process.py combines both heightmap and contours with terrain to give
a contoured map with slightly darker deep parts. It also flips the
images horizontally and vertically, because the source images are the
wrong way round.

The result is a 24-bit PNG, which the converter then converts into
8-bit indexed.
